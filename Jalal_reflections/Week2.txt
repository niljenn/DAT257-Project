What do I want to learn or understand better? Consider e.g. teamwork, Scrum, agile processes, technologies etc? 
During this week, I learned how important it is to have a good task distribution and communication within the team. 
In the last sprint, some team members finished their tasks before the others, which made it difficult for those who were not finished to contribute to the project.
Therefore, this week we focused more on dividing the tasks into smaller pieces, so everyone would have something to work on during the sprint.
Additionally, I continued to improve my skills in HTML and CSS, and I feel more confident in using them now compared to the previous week.

 What is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries? How can I help my team do better next sprint?
I also provided some suggestions for how to improve the website's design and functionality. Moreover, I shared some of my knowledge in HTML and CSS with my teammates who were struggling with their tasks.
To help the team do better next sprint, I will continue to encourage clear communication within the team and try to identify potential issues before they arise. My main task was to design the catagory result page in which I designed a working page were you could see how sustainable the companies in the chosen catagory are. 
It is important to point that the design of the page was very minimal as further improvment will be added in the upcoming springs.

changes/improvements from last week's reflection?
We have begun working more on the website and we have more working functions.
