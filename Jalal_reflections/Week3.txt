What do I want to learn or understand better? Consider e.g. teamwork, Scrum, agile processes, technologies etc? 
Next week, I plan to focus more on the programming side of the project. However, we have faced difficulties in distributing the workload between us in a way that allows each team member to handle both research and programming simultaneously.

 What is my contribution towards the teamâ€™s deliveries? How can I help my team do better next sprint?
This week, my task was to collect data on the environmental impact of two companies: H&M and Zara. I studied their ESG reporting and gathered relevant information, including their CO2 emissions, plastic recycling, and animal welfare practices, as well as their contributions to achieving the UN's sustainable development goals.

changes/improvements from last week's reflection?
Compared to last week, we have made significant improvements in task distribution and communication within the team. By dividing the tasks into smaller pieces, everyone was able to contribute more evenly to the project, which resulted in a more efficient and productive sprint. Additionally, I feel that my understanding of agile methodologies has increased, and I am more confident in my ability to work with an agile mindset.
