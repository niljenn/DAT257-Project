What do I want to learn or understand better? Consider e.g. teamwork, Scrum, agile processes, technologies etc? 
My task this week was to work on 

 What is my contribution towards the teamâ€™s deliveries? How can I help my team do better next sprint?
I also provided some suggestions for how to improve the website's design and functionality. Moreover, I shared some of my knowledge in HTML and CSS with my teammates who were struggling with their tasks.
To help the team do better next sprint, I will continue to encourage clear communication within the team and try to identify potential issues before they arise. My main task was to design the catagory result page in which I designed a working page were you could see how sustainable the companies in the chosen catagory are. 
It is important to point that the design of the page was very minimal as further improvment will be added in the upcoming springs.

changes/improvements from last week's reflection?
Compared to last week, we have made significant improvements in task distribution and communication within the team. By dividing the tasks into smaller pieces, everyone was able to contribute more evenly to the project, which resulted in a more efficient and productive sprint. Additionally, I feel that my understanding of agile methodologies has increased, and I am more confident in my ability to work with an agile mindset.
