What do I want to learn or understand better? Consider e.g. teamwork, Scrum, agile processes, technologies etc? 

I am continuing to build on what I have learned in previous weeks in both Scrum and programming.
Specifically, I want to use my role as scrum master to improve our team's productivity, efficiency and
communicatin. As a team leader, I also want to strengthen my skills in teamwork and collaboration.

What is my contribution towards the teamâ€™s deliveries? How can I help my team do better next sprint?

This sprint had focus on other areas than jost coding. Although that was a key part where I continuted to develop the same skills as before,
this week consisted more of data collection. Since we have a solid foundation, the next week will also consist of more collection of data and
fixing areas of the code which need fixing. 


Changes/improvements from last week's reflection?
I have realized the importance of flexibility and adaptability in responding to changing project needs. 
While coding remains an essential aspect of our work, I recognize that other tasks may require more attention at certain times. 
Therefore, I plan to remain open to new challenges and opportunities for growth as they arise.
