What do I want to learn or understand better? Consider e.g. teamwork, Scrum, agile processes, technologies etc? 

I think one of the important asepcts where I and the team have been lacking is the division and evalution of work. As
I have the role as scrum master, I feel like this is especially important for me to focus on. This week I feel like we 
could have accomplished more than we have, even though we managed to complete all tasks which we had planned. I think 
we should have considered how long the work would take during the planning so that we could have achieved more. 

What is my contribution towards the teamâ€™s deliveries? How can I help my team do better next sprint?

This sprint I continued where I left from last week with data collection, which looked very similar to the week prior. 
I also started adding real companies in place of our fake, placeholder companies with real logos and names. 


Changes/improvements from last week's reflection?
I have now realized what needs more focus, like mentioned earlier, the planning stages where not thouroughly thought through,
which led to our workload not being distributed in a way where we weren't as effecient as we can. This will be considred more 
in the future.
