What do I want to learn or understand better? Consider e.g. teamwork, Scrum, agile processes, technologies, etc.?

I do not think there are are any areas new areas I wish to explore. I mainly want to continue on the same path as I have
to establish more of what I have already learnt. 

What is my contribution towards the teamâ€™s deliveries? How can I help my team do better next sprint?

I have contributed with several aspects of the code which touched on different areas of the website. We have now
implemented all core functionalities which we want for the last sprint where we can focus on more of the design aspects.
I worked on establishing this overall structure and ensuring all members would have accomplished what was needed to reach that goal. 

Changes/improvements from last week's reflection?

Based on the lessons learned from last week, we have made some changes to our planning process.
We now spend more time discussing and estimating the effort required for each task,
considering the team's capacity and ensuring a balanced workload distribution.
By doing so, we aim to increase our overall efficiency and productivity into our final sprint.
