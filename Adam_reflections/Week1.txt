What do I want to learn or understand better? Consider e.g. teamwork, Scrum, agile processes, technologies etc? 

I decided to take on the role of scrum master for this project because I'm curious about how the scrum framework
works and I want most of all learn how to lead a team effectively. For this first sprint, I've focused on improving my skills as a
team leader. We also decided to work on creating a website since none of us have done so before, which I'm actually looking forward to
as it gives me the chance to learn new programming languages and broaden my skill set.

What is my contribution towards the teamâ€™s deliveries? How can I help my team do better next sprint?

I feel like I haven't been fully embraced my role as the scrum master during this first sprint,
but I've been working on it and will continuosly do so. I've been trying my best to observe the team and communicate with them in a way
that is clear and helpful for our work, while also being generally positive and uplifting. 


Changes/improvements from last week's reflection?
