Sprint 4 Reflection

1. What do I want to learn or understand better? Consider e.g. teamwork, Scrum, agile processes, technologies etc?

I want to learn to estimate work time better after this sprint. The team and I have, during earlier sprints,
been doing a good job of estimating the time of the user stories, but this week we/I did not do a good job. So I want 
to learn to actually give more time to reflect on how long something might take. Regarding the code I want to learn 
how to connect different parts of html elements as best as possible, as this has been a bit of a struggle this far. 

2. What is my contribution towards the teamâ€™s deliveries? How can I help my team do better next sprint?

This week my focus was to help with connecting the search function to the search view that we were supposed to have. 
Although we had an algorithm from last week, something did not work when we tried to connect the two things, so another
member that had to change parts of that code. Which led to scratching the part that I had worked on, the good thing is
that it wasn't a lot of code that we removed. Other than this I gathered information this week. Overall though, I could 
have gotten more work done this sprint. I don't really know why I didn't do more, but I belive it was because we 
decided who should do what at the beginning of the week and when I was done I didn't think to start something else. 
Next week I will help the team by taking more action, and when I feel that me or someone else is finished early with the 
work assigned to them I will try to start a discussion of what more can be done. 

3. Changes/improvements from last week's reflection?

The changes are that sometimes the work that has been done has to be scratched or modified, to make the code better,
like the search function. But I improved how to work in javascript, I learned more abot using html and javascript together, like 
connecting buttons.
