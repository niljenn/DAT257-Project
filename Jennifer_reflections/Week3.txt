Sprint 3 Reflection

1. What do I want to learn or understand better? Consider e.g. teamwork, Scrum, agile processes, technologies etc?

I still want to learn more about javascript. I worked with javascript for the first time this week, and while 
I've learned a lot, there is more to learn. For next week I want to "learn" how to gather data about the
companies efficiently, since gathering data can easily become overwhelming with a lot of information that might
not even be relevant.

2. What is my contribution towards the teamâ€™s deliveries? How can I help my team do better next sprint?

This week my contribution was to create a search function for the website that the user can use to search for a
specific company, for example. A search function can be implemented in many ways, with different difficulties, 
the team chose to create one that would be simple. So when searching for a company the algorithm will look at the 
letters and see if they match any company's name in the list. Also the first letter typed should be the priority, 
and therefore placed at the top. I have also communicated to the team how far along I've come during the week, and
tried my best to contribute to the discussions. But I could've been better at that this week.  

3. Changes/improvements from last week's reflection?

Some changes/improvements from last week is that I understand javascript better, which makes it easier for me to
understand some code that the others have written, that I didn't before. I believe that I also understood how to
more effectivly divide the user stories between us team members this week, because I think we did a good job at it. 
Personally though I could have created tasks for my user story this week, but since the task was pretty straight
forward I didn't know what to write except "create a search function".
