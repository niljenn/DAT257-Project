Sprint 1 Reflection

1. What do I want to learn or understand better? Consider e.g. teamwork, Scrum, agile processes, technologies etc?

For next week I want to understand HTML and CSS better, so that I can be more efficient when programming
for the website. The main focus lies in understanding how HTML is built and how to use the different
elements together. It would also be beneficial to understand more of the attributes in CSS so that I can build
the different elements correctly and also be more efficient with it. Regarding Scrum, I feel like I need to get a 
better understanding of how the backlog is used to help with choosing what tasks to prioritize that Sprint. 
As a team I belvieve we should work on being more clear about plans and meetings.


2. What is my contribution towards the teamâ€™s deliveries? How can I help my team do better next sprint?

My contribution to the team's deliveries this week was learning HTML and CSS, having this knowledge makes it
possible to help the others when starting off. I also contribute in the discussions to keep the ideas flowing, and 
so that we as a team can understand each other better. In the next Sprint I will try to ask more questions to 
the other group members to understand them better and not have any miscommunication.
