1. What do I want to learn or understand better? Consider e.g. teamwork, Scrum, agile processes, technologies etc? 
I wanna have a better understanding of how javaScript works.

2. What is my contribution towards the teamâ€™s deliveries? How can I help my team do better next sprint?

I have updated many parts of the website to make it easier to navigate and understand. On the category page I have turned the sort 
buttons into a dropdown button instead. Now the button will also show which sort function is active by chnaging the name on the 
dropdown button to the current state. This is also how I've seen many other website having it so it might look more familiar to the user.
On the start page I designed a background images and placed the features onto that. Then I Updated the search bar so that the placeholder 
text disapears when on focus and the placeholder and text you write have the same fontsize and color. This makes it easier for the user 
to regocnize that the search box is active and ready to be used. I also udated the header with our logo and made some other small adjustments 
with the menu. On the detail page I added a company logo and website to the detail page.

3. Changes/improvements from last week's reflection?
We have gotten more done this week and it seems like the work have been distributed more equally than last week.
I also feel like I have gotten a better understanding of the overall system this week when I've been working updating 
features I haven't worked with before.
