1. What do I want to learn or understand better? Consider e.g. teamwork, Scrum, agile processes, technologies etc? 
Since I haven’t had much time for the project this week I would still want do learn more about the parts of the website 
they I haven’t been working on  to get a better overall understanding of our system.

2. What is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries? How can I help my team do better next sprint?
I haven’t had much time to work on the project this week but I have done what I’ve been signed up for which was gather 
information about a food company. Next week I wanna do more programming. Especially I want to improve the design of the website.

3. Changes/improvements from last week's reflection?
We’ve been doing almost the same but switched who’ve been programming and who’ve been gathering information about the companies. 
Otherwise we haven’t changed much. We probably could have done more this sprint.
