1. What do I want to learn or understand better? Consider e.g. teamwork, Scrum, agile processes, technologies etc? 

I wanna learn more about how we can present our data and what data is available and possible for us to work with. I also wanna look 
into how we can collect the data in an efficient way. 
I would also wanna learn more about how you implement a search bar if there's time.

2. What is my contribution towards the teamâ€™s deliveries? How can I help my team do better next sprint?

I have built the first version of the page showing a detailed view of one Company. What has taken most work is connecting the
page that leads to the detailed view so that it updates the right information depending on what company was chosen on the previous
page. I also struggled a lot with github and couldn't upload my stuff until the last day, therefore we also had some trouble 
working together on this page. The next sprint I'm gonna help my team by gathering data about the companys and fixing what
didn't work out as we wanted this week. If there is time I would also wanna learn more about how to implement the search bar
and then be able to help out if my team mate gets stuck.

3. Changes/improvements from last week's reflection?

We definetly have a better structure for our ToDo's and they are much better explained. We now write the user story directly 
on the card, which makes it easier to understand. We have had more time to spend on working individually and less discussing how we should 
plan the project. At the end of the week we did understand that not everyone felt the same, especially the ones working in a group 
on the same part of the project. Therefore we gonna try and divide the work into smaller pieces so that everyone has their own thing to focus on.

I have also learnt a lot about html and css and spent had more time programming this sprint.
