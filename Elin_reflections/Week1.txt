1. What do I want to learn or understand better? Consider e.g. teamwork, Scrum, agile processes, technologies etc? 

I think our teamwork so far is going well considering how early in the process we are. Waht I could do better regarding 
teamwork is be a better listener and. Other than that, we do have some different opinions on how to plan our project 
in a agile way but hopefully we will learn more about that next week when we can clearify some stuff with our TA. I also 
wanna learn more about the basics in web programing. We have learned the importance of making the To-Do's more precise
and to divide them into smaller groups than we first thought to make them easier to understand and use.

2. What is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries? How can I help my team do better next sprint?

I have focused mostly on the mockup/prototype for our website this sprint and I think that have helped us to commonly
visualise our product to make it easier to discuss and make sure we are working towards the same goal. The next week I
would like to learn more about HTML so that we can work together in teams with the same base knowledge. I think we 
will work togther more effecient next week now that we have sorted out most of the backlog and now can focus on 
developing our product. We haven't delegated any specific workload for next week yet but until then my main goal will 
be to learn as much as possible about web programming. I could also learn more about the agile process to make sure I
know and don't just think I know, since there has been some confusion around it.
