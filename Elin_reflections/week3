1. What do I want to learn or understand better? Consider e.g. teamwork, Scrum, agile processes, technologies etc? 

I wanna get to know the other parts of the program that I havenät worked on better and read through those files to get a better overall understanding.

2. What is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries? How can I help my team do better next sprint?

This sprint I have implented a way to reuse the header on each page, which let us reuse the code instead of copy and pasting. This also
makes it easier to change the features of the headerwithout having to change the code on each page. I'm not sure yet what my role will 
be next sprint, we will decide that on monday. But I could be better next week at communicating my progress.

3. Changes/improvements from last week's reflection?

I thought that making a reusable component would be very easy but it took way more time than I expected. The main implentation wasn't too hard but
there were some details to the code that I didn't understand fully that kept the code from working. But unlike last week when I tried to connect the 
category page to the detailCompany page, I did succeed this time which is an improvement. I think that it was a good idea that Angelica took over
since I was stuck and she was able to look at the problem in a new way. I then also got the chance to start fresh and got to solve a new problem. 
I didn't want to let go of last weeks problem at first but in the end I think this led to the best outcome/progress for both the project and team. 

Except this, our workoload was also divided better this sprint and everyone had their own task to handle, which led to better teamwork and progress.
