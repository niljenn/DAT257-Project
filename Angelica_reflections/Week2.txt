- What do I want to learn or understand better?

I want to learn a bit more about the frontend parts of the project, as I have mostly worked on the backend code so far.
Next week I will therefore put some time and energy into learning a bit more about placing out the visual elements
on a website by actually doing it and not just watching tutorials on the matter as I already have. 
I will also be collecting data that we can use to display the different companies and their scores correctly, no more 'fake information'.



-What is my contribution towards the team's deliveries? How can I help my team do better next sprint?

I created a class for the companies that will be able to hold all their specific information, we can use this object
to display all relevant information depending on which page we are at on the website. 
I have also helped the team move forward by dealing with a few Git problems that arised this week so that we 
were able to continue working effectively and not get stuck. 
I have also been very active in the chat and in all discussions, for example discussions of 
how to fairly split the workload and who is responsible for what in the upcoming sprint next week.



- Changes/improvements from last week's reflection?

I feel like we have all improved this week in terms of communication, but instead we lacked 
a little bit in the division of the workload as some did a lot more than others.
Also not everyone has worked on all parts of the project, some only worked on the frontend,
while others only worked on the backend etc. 
This is why we had a good discussion about this today at the 'wrap up' of the week and we started planning
on how to split the workload more fairly in the future so that everyone gets to work on everything and have equal
amounts of work to do for the upcoming sprints, as well as the project in its entirety.
