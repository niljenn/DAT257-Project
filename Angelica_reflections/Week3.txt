- What do I want to learn or understand better?

This week I learned some more about HTML and Javascript, and next week I will focus on gathering
relevant information and where one is able to find trustworthy sources. 



-What is my contribution towards the team's deliveries? How can I help my team do better next sprint?

In sprint 3 I am happy with my contribution to the team's deliveries as I was responsible for making the functionality of
the category page's interactability  in terms of the companies displayed being clickable and leading to their individual detail page.
This detail page is dynamically filled out with the relevant company's information which is gathered from the company object that holds all the information.


- Changes/improvements from last week's reflection?

This week we did better at distributing the workload, but we felt that we can still do better and therefore next week we will try to let
the team members that didn't code much get some more code responsibilities so that everyone has taken part in the final product.
