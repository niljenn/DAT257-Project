- What do I want to learn or understand better?

I want to learn some more CSS as I've mostly contributed to the backend code so far.



-What is my contribution towards the team's deliveries? How can I help my team do better next sprint?

This week I took a smaller role in the team by letting the team members that had not yet coded anything take over the parts
of the code that we needed to get done this week. Instead I focused on gathering information about some companies for our database, 
and simply helped a little bit with the design and CSS parts of the code. For example, I helped make the header stay the same
throughout the entire website using code reuse, and also made the background color stay even when scrolling far down on the category page. 


- Changes/improvements from last week's reflection?

This week we made sure that the team members that had not yet coded any backend code got to try that. 
Everyone in the team seems happy with this and the workload feels more even now compared to other sprints.
