I want to learn how to work well and communicate effectively in our project's agile process because it will improve our teamwork.
Good teamwork is crucial for a positive experience and successful results.
Therefore it is important for everyone to be on the same page with our goals and expectations.
Better communication among team members is key to achieving this,
as there is always room for improvement in how we interact and understand each other.

I try my best to do well in my tasks, stay positive about my workload,
and understand my team members.
I believe in motivating a positive work environment by giving compliments and
creating a supportive atmosphere that encourages everyone to do their best.

Since this is my first reflection on the project,
there are no past reflections to compare or improve upon from the previous week.
