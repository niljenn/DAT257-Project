I want to fully understand how our application presents the data about companies since this is the core selling point of our project.
If this aspect does not function correctly, the entire idea behind our project could fail.

I know I need to improve my approach, but to do that, I must take a more significant role in the group.
Otherwise, it will be hard for me to motivate others, express my opinions and perform to the best of my ability.
However, I feel slightly uncomfortable in this group setting as I canâ€™t take that much space, and I am unsure how to change that.
I thought I knew how to handle it, but now I'm not so sure.

During the last sprint, our team mostly focused on discussing how to begin the project.
As a result, we recognized that planning and communication need improvement on the upcoming sprints.

In terms of my own performance, I faced challenges when working on a user story that multiple team members were also working on.
Due to potential merge conflicts in the code, I took a step back and played a more supportive role.
For the next sprint, I recommend dividing larger user stories into smaller parts that can be more easily tackled individually.
Additionally, we need to define user stories more clearly, as it was often confusing to determine what needed to be done,
particularly when multiple people were involved in the same task.
