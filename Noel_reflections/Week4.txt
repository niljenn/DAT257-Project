I'm intrigued by the idea of creating and designing animations for webpages.
I find it fascinating how movement can bring a sense of liveliness and realism.
However, I'm uncertain about the complexity and time required to implement animations.
It might be more practical to focus on other tasks since animations are not essential for functionality.
Still, I have the aspiration to explore and learn more about animation techniques.

I would appreciate improved collaboration within the group.
Working together would make the experience more enjoyable.
Currently, it feels like we are working individually rather than as a cohesive team.
While this might be how the scrum framework operates, I genuinely desire more collaborative work and open discussions.

I worked on both frontend and backend code for the search page, but unfortunately, it didn't meet the standards required for our final project.
Although I still learned a lot from the experience, I feel somewhat undervalued as a team member compared to others.
Despite knowing the group members for a while, I haven't had much prior experience working with all of them together.
It's challenging for me to express differing opinions within the group, perhaps because I don't feel fully integrated.
I may have made a mistake by joining this group, and I had hoped that new people would also join the group to bring some change to the group dynamic.
I often feel stuck in the role of the shy outsider, and it's difficult to change that when it seems like the group isn't fully receptive.
I recognize that this might be mostly my own fault.
I know that in future jobs, I'll encounter new and different people, and it's crucial to work effectively with them, even if we don't immediately "click".
The ability to collaborate with diverse individuals is a valuable soft skill, and it's important to learn from our mistakes along the way.

I gained additional knowledge about programming functional websites.
In our group, we had a productive discussion about the design and layout of the company detail page,
which was helpful, even though my input in the discussion not being as appreciated as that of others.
Personally, I value discussions because they provide valuable insights and different perspectives.
It's enlightening to hear others' opinions and viewpoints, as it expands our understanding.
I believe there are no definitive right or wrong answers or approaches, it's important to explore different possibilities and iterate on existing ideas.
This fosters a stronger sense of collaboration within the group.
