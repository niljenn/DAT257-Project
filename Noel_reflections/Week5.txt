I want to improve my web design skills, focusing on creating engaging and realistic websites.
Additionally, I'm interested in exploring advanced animation techniques to enhance the visual appeal of the website.


2.
I created an "About Us" page and a "Why Choose Us" page, as well as made design enhancements to the existing webpages.
I also incorporated a simple animation, and in the future, I aim to explore more advanced animation techniques.
Having the freedom to be creative with the "About Us" and "Why Choose Us" pages was a rewarding experience.
I enjoy the process of experimenting with different ideas and approaches to design.
It allows for the exploration of completely new concepts, which is truly enlightening.
I believe that an iterative approach is essential to discover visually pleasing elements, although it can be time-consuming.
I wonder if there are ways to improve the effectiveness of this process, or if it is something that naturally improves with more knowledge and experience.

I made improvements in my understanding of website design, which helped me create more attractive and engaging webpages.
However, in terms of collaboration within the group, I haven't noticed significant changes.
I still feel somewhat disconnected and not fully integrated into the group dynamics.
Although we have had interactions and discussions, there is still room for improvement in fostering a more inclusive and collaborative environment.
I believe that open and constructive communication, as well as active participation from all members, are important for creating a cohesive and productive team.
